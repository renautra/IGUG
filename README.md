Gravity inversion using graph theory

IGUG: A MATLAB package for 3D inversion of gravity data using graph theory
Saeed Vatankhah, Vahid E. Ardestani, Susan S. Niri,  Rosemary A. Renaut and Dr Hojjat Kabirzadeh

The package presented is used for the inversion of gravity data using graph theory. 
It is based on extensions of a method first presented in
Bijani, R., Ponte-Neto, C. F., Carlos, D. U., Silva Dias, F. J. S., 2015. Three-dimensional gravity inversion using graph theory to delineate the skeleton of homogeneous sources, Geophysics, 80, G53-G66.

The package contains a document that describes the implementation and usage of the Matlab scripts and functions. 
Examples of the solutions for provided simulated data sets are also given at
